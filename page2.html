    <h1>Traits and Ideals</h1>
    <p>Those with the Blue personality type tend to be described as warm, peaceful, and sympathetic. In work, Blues tend to inspire others and tend to have an active mind. You might display characteristics such as: being a good listener, loyal, have a strong intuition, or show more empathy than others. </p>

    <p> In love, Blues seek balanced, true love that will last a lifetime. They typically enjoy traditional gifts such as flowers or a dinner date, and are constantly searching for something that will last a lifetime. </p>



    <p>Additionally, Blues are known to be active and imagineable during childhood. It is to be noted that this doesn't really change in adulthood. </p>

    <p> Things that may stress out a Blue personaltiy type include: broken promises, negative criticism, conflict, insincerity, lying, and rejection. </p>

     <p> This personality type may be suited to certain careers as well. These include: Human resources manager, minister, editor, therapist, journalist, social worker, fund raiser, employment interviewer, flight attendant, host/hostess, receptionist, tour guide, travel agent, customer service, or a teacher. </p>

<h1> How You Percieve Yourself, and How Others Percieve You </h1>
    <p>The Blue personality type tends to view themselves as the kind, hopeless romantic. This isn't a bad thing, either. Due to their social nature and hopeful outlook, Blues, while being named after a cool color, find themselves to be warm. Romantic, affirming, and a compassionate people pleaser, this charismatic personality type has several self-identifiable traits. </p>

    <p> Traits that the Blue personality may see within themselves: Idealist, relatable, great communicator, spiritual, selfless, empathetic, trusting, a hard worker, and they tend to find themselves promoting their well-being and personal growth. </p>

    <p> Along with these traits, there are a few conflictions that lead to the Blue personality being frustrated or upset by certain behavior. Just like anyone, there is a small list of things that particularly frustrate Blues. Behavior such as lying, violence, sarcasm, and personal rejection tend to drive this personality type away. However, lack of communication and a lack of close friends can personally distress a Blue personality, without it being anyone's fault in particular. </p>

    <p> Despite this, the Blue personality is never afraid of praise. When their unique contributions, personality, achievements, and honesty are energetically and sincerely praised, they gain a feeling of usefulness, and know they have importance and significance to the well-being of others. </p>

    <p> However, others tend to view the Blue personality a bit differently. </p>
    <p> Traits that others view within the Blue personality usually lean to the more negative side. Others may view this as: overly emotional, mushy, hopelessly naiive, easily duped, pushover, too nice, too trusting, too soft, too touchy-feely, too tender-hearted, and hopelessly stuck in the past. </p>

    <p> Along with these negative views on the Blue's traits, there are also behaviors that may annoy or frustrate someone. Sometimes, they feel as if Blues have a lack of planning, are too obsessive, suppress their problems, are too generous, overly sentimental, and tend to avoid conflict a little too much. </p>

    <h1> On a Bad Day </h1>
      <p> Everyone has bad days. However, different personality types react differently to their bad luck. </p>

      <p> Blues on a bad day tend to withdraw, cry or pout, yell, become depressed, feel put down, fish for compliments, or just day dream. Some of these behaviors, while negative, are not unexpected from such a passive, romantic personality type. </p>

      <p> Many of these behaviors, such as yelling or compliment fishing, are very much frowned upon. This could make one's day worse, or encourage the behavior further. This can lead to them saying how much they are not liked, lying to save face, or show passive resistance. Encouraging this behavior is not advised. </p>
